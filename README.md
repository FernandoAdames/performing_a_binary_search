# performing_a_binary_search
in this repository I practice the search method binary Search.
The general Idea of a binary search is to find a target (value) with a sorted array of elements quickly by reducing the number of operations.
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the sorted array.
Binary search is significantly faster than linear search (O(n)) for large datasets because it reduces the search space by half in each iteration.
